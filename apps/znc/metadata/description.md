# ZNC

ZNC is an advanced IRC bouncer that keeps you connected to your favorite IRC networks even when you're offline. Acting as an always‑on proxy between you and IRC servers, it maintains session continuity, message buffering, and multi‑client connectivity — making it ideal for persistent IRC access across devices.

## Overview

When your IRC client connects through ZNC, it joins channels and remains active even if your client disconnects or your network drops. Upon reconnection, ZNC replays chat history so you never miss messages. It also provides a built‑in web administration panel for easy user and network management.

## Key Features

- **Persistent Connectivity:** Stay connected to IRC 24/7, even if your local client is offline.  
- **Message Buffering:** Automatically replays messages you missed during downtime.  
- **Multi‑Client Support:** Connect from multiple devices using a single nickname.  
- **Web Interface:** Administer servers, modules, and users directly from your browser.  
- **Modular Architecture:** Extend functionality using a rich library of community modules.  
- **SSL Support:** Secure both client and upstream IRC connections with TLS certificates.  
- **Cross‑Platform:** Lightweight and runs seamlessly on Linux, macOS, Windows, and ARM devices.

## Typical Use Case

ZNC is perfect for users who want their IRC presence to remain online around the clock—such as developers, server administrators, or chat network operators. Install it once, configure your IRC networks, and connect effortlessly from any device, anywhere.
